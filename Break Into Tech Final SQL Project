##For this SQL, I queried a Break Into Tech course database with multiple tables to review and analyze data.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <>'USA'

#2. Show only the customers from the Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country='Brazil'

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT i.Invoiceid, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry, c.FirstName, c.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.invoiceid=c.customerid
WHERE i.BillingCountry='Brazil'

#4. Show the employees who are sales agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title like '%Agent%'

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, i.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.Employeeid=c.SupportRepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.Customerid=i.Customerid

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT i.Total, c.FirstName as custfirst, c.LastName as custlast, c.Country,
e.FirstName as agentfirst, e.LastName as agentlast
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerID=i.Customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.SupportRepid=e.Employeeid

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

#10. Find the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
ON t.Trackid=i.Trackid

#11. Find purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name as track, a.Name as artist, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
ON t.TrackID=i.Trackid
JOIN albums
ON albums.albumid=t.Albumid
JOIN chinook.artists a
ON a.Artistid=albums.Artistid

#12. Show all the Tracks and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name as track,
a.Title as album,
m.Name as media_type,
g.Name as genre
FROM tracks t
JOIN genres g ON t.Genreid=g.Genreid
JOIN albums a ON t.Albumid=t.Albumid
JOIN media_types m ON t.MediaTypeid=m.MediaTypeid
GROUP BY t.Name ORDER BY t.Name

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'total sales'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers
ON customers.SupportRepid=e.Employeeid
JOIN invoices i
ON customers.Customerid=i.Customerid
WHERE e.Title='Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.FirstName

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'total'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON e.Employeeid=c.SupportRepid
JOIN invoices i
ON i.Customerid=c.Customerid
WHERE e.Title='Sales Support Agent' AND i.InvoiceDate like '2009%'
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY total desc LIMIT 1

#15. What is the most common genre purchased?
SELECT COUNT(t.Genreid) as 'purchases', g.Name as genre
FROM tracks t
JOIN genres g
ON t.Genreid=g.Genreid
GROUP BY g.Name
